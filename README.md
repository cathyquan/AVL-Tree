# AVL-Tree
AVL Tree Data Structure

An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary tree. Each time a node is inserted or deleted, the tree conducts a set of rotations to maintain balance between the left and right subtrees. For this project, I built a sample AVL Tree to dynamically manage student information for the University of Florida. Each node in the tree consists of a student's name and GatorID.

Functions created:
  - insert: inserting a node into an AVL Tree
  - remove: deleting a node from an AVL Tree
  - searchID: searching for the node with the passed-in GatorID and printing out the name of the student with that ID
  - searchName: searching for the node with the passed-in name and printing out the ID number of each student with a matching name
  - printInorder: conducting an inorder traversal of the tree and printing the names associated with each node
  - printPreorder: conducting a preorder traversal of the tree and printing the names associated with each node
  - printPostorder: conducting a postorder traversal of the tree and printing the names associated with each node
  - printLevelCount: printing the number of levels in the tree
  - removeInorder: removing the Nth node from the tree when conducting an inorder traversal
